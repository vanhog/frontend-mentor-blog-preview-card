## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most important thing Iâ€™ve learned is: plan first, code second. It was a great experience to examine the design system first, take notes on the screenshots, and create a **sketch** as part of my HTML planning.

### Continued development

Don't code before you have a plan!
